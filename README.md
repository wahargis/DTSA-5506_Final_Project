Data Mining Methods final project 

- RFM analysis is performed on the Retail II Kaggle dataset of an anonymized eCommerce retailer's transaction data.
- Clustering algorithms are used to perform customer segmentation for actionable customer retention and advertising strategies.
- Churn prediction is performed using a supervised approach to see if clustering labels improve churn prediction beyond that produced on the RFM analytic categorization.
